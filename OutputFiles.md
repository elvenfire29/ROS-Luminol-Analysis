# Script Output Files

The output depends on the selections of the user in the user input sections. The user can include a folder with t-test results, a folder with ANOVA results, and/or a file with graphs in the output folder. The output folder will appear in the location set as the working directory in the User Input I section. 

The output that is always included is an output folder named after the input file. This folder will always contain a file with Total ROS Counts for each replicate and averaged for each treatment. There will also always be a subfolder called "PRISM and Graphing Data" containing treatment average luminescence over time, individual luminescence over time per treatment, as well as files ready for graphing software, such as PRISM, with averages or sums.  

Here is a figure of the full possible output from the script:
